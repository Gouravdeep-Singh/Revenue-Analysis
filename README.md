# Revenue-Analysis
The aim of this project is to analyze and build a dashboard based on a dataset acquired via kaggle. It involves usage of SQL, MS excel and Tableau. The dataset was formed by executing the sql query attached. Many columns based on their impact on revenue were removed and data was tramsfered to MS excel. There it was analyzed using pivot tables as well as a prototype dashboard. After that it was loaded in Tableau to form various vizulizations. It contains filters as well to make it more interactive for the users.
