# Revenue-Analysis
# Objective:
This project involves analyzing and building a dashboard based on a dataset acquired via kaggle. It involves usage of SQL, MS excel and Tableau. We try to figure out revenue based on year, months and types of hotels.
# Analyzing dada:
Many columns based on their impact on revenue were removed and data was transfered to MS excel. There it was cleaned and  analyzed using pivot tables as well as a prototype dashboard was made. After that it was loaded in Tableau to form various vizulizations. It contains filters as well to make it more interactive for the users.
